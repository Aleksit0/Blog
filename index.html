      <p class = "text"> Hacktoberfest 2021, a great opportunity for open-sourcers and anyone who wants to GROW as a developer. 
          Not only does it teach you to contribute to other repos, it teaches you to work in and as a team.</p>

      <h2 class = "naslov"> Get in touch.. </h2>
      <p class = "text"> As we all know, exposing yourself is VERY important. Not only does
          it helps you to find new developers and friends, it helps you communicate width
          coding community in general. Some of the most popular platforms for "exposing"
          yourself are: Reddit, DEV, Stackoverlow, Quora, Twitter. Also, TikTok is not
          really bad for self-promotion.. </p>

    <div class = "objava">
      <h2 class = "naslov"> Learning Resources</h2>
      <p class = "text"> We all know that programming is all about learning. Learning new skills
          everyday makes you a better programmer. It makes your skillset richer and more diverse.
          With that said, here are some free learning resources: FreeCodeCamp, Coursera, Medium,
          Stackoverlow, Github.. There are more of them but these ones are THE BEST. </p>

    <div class = "objava">
      <h2 class = "naslov"> Workflow</h2>
      <p class = "text"> Every developer has its own programming workflow. It is something that
          makes your day-to-day work MUCH easier. A workflow is considered as what editor, console or
          language you are using. Some of my workflow things are: Visual Studio Code, Alacritty, 
          GitBash, Jupyter Notebook and Python for sure.</p>
